## Usage

Link to webpage: https://famava.github.io/workday-schedule-mod5/
<br/> 
<br/>
<br/>To use this webpage, you type a task into whichever time-bock you would like. Then, to save it, you press the save button (the blue floppy disk) associated with that time-block, and it will save the task to your computer's local storage. Once it is saved, that task will render on the time-block even if you refresh the page. Each time-block is color-coded (red for present, light-grey for past, and green for future). The color coding of the time blocks resets at midnight.
